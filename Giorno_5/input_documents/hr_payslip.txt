Dear EY HR Team,

I am Giulia Verdi (giulia.verdi@outlook.it), hired on 09/01/2022, working at the Bologna office.  
My tax ID is VRDGLL94A41A944C and my bank account for salary payments is IT80P0306909606100000123456.

I would like to ask whether the 2024 income statement (CU) is available and if it will be uploaded to the MyEY platform.

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,  
Giulia Verdi
