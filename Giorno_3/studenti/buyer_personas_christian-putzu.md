# Exercise:

## 1. **In-depth segment description**  
- Segment description: 

I want to describe customers of smartphone market where there are some main segments of customers such as Apple os customers Android os customers.

Apple customers spend hundreds of euros to buy a smartphone and are very loyal and fidelized into the Apple platform, with high switch cost and are costricted to buy other Aplles compatible devices to connect or use other services. They are interested in design, fashion and style and also for the trends.

Android customers spend less than Apple customers and are more interested to save money rather than to appear fashion or have the better design. Often, they have less switch costs and are less loyal or fidelized because they can choose a lot of different smartphone brands which adopt Android os, finally they can choose to utilize more compatible devices to implement functionalities/services.

## 2. **Persona generation**  
- Prompt:
